VBudapest, the city I owned and lost, the city that stole my love but won my heart, the city I love and hate, you will forever stay in my memory, with all the tears and laughters, sorrow and joy. I would not call this Spring a great semester. Great is just not the word to describe it. It was mind-blowing, breath-taking, and... as a wonderful friend put it: it was worthwhile, absolutely worthwhile. I will not miss you, because you will be with me wherever I go.
